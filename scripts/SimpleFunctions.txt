# Example 1: of a simple Functions and their output:
def foo(a b) a+b;
foo(5, 10); # evaluates to 15

# Example 2: of a simple Functions and their output:
def bar(a b) a*a + 2*a*b + b*b;
bar(1, 2); # evaluates to 9
bar(1, 3); # evaluates to 16

# Example 3: of a simple Functions and their output:
def baz(x y) x + y*2;
baz(1, 2); # evaluates to 5
baz(1, 3); # evaluates to 7

# Example 4: Simple program to print values to the terminal:
extern printd(x);
printd(7); # prints the number 7

# Example 5: Simple program to convert decimal to ascii values, then output to the terminal:
extern putchard(x);
putchard(43);  # ascii 43 = '+'

# Example 6: Low-precedence operator that ignores operands:
def binary : 1 (x y) 0;
putchard(42) : putchard(43); # processes both and prints '*' and '+'
